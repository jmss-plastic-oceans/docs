# Adding articles to the POA website
## This guide is for members only.

1. Go to [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJ5EX-8RbNiuJ28sq_SwswLtMyHY9yy61s1oLEyM5mA/edit?usp=sharing) and log in using an authorised account (allowed access to the POA google drive)
2. Create a [new Google Doc](https://docs.new) and put in **only the article body** (no title or subtitle)
3. Make this Google Doc able to be **viewed by everyone on the internet**.
4. Copy the sharing link and paste it in Column C of the spreadsheet (new row)
5. Fill in the title, subtitle and date written.
    - Neither the title nor the subtitle can have commas. Please make sure there are **no commas** or the website will not work (we're working on fixing this).
6. Find an image on the internet for your thumbnail (**make sure we have rights to use it!**). Here are some good sites for free (no attribution) images:
    - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
7. Paste the image **direct link** into the box for it in Column D (must end in .png or .jpeg - NOT a Google Drive link)
8. Finish off by ticking the 'Publish' button when you want to publish.

Done :)
